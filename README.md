# Paper Analysis Toolkit (name in progress)

- `citations/` includes classes and utils for extracting information about references and citations from markdown papers.
- `notebooks/` includes helpful snippets of code, not yet ready for large scale usage, but helpful to explain workflows.
- `logs/` includes helpful info while running scrpts.
- `results/` includes intermediate computation to be stored in case of failures during long runs.
- `pickle/` includes saved objects (document corpuses, models, etc.) for later debugging or reuse.
- `data/` includes anything that might be used to derive results (markdown files, CSVs, etc.)
